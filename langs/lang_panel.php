                    <h6>In this panel/round table, three scholars will give a speech within 60 minutes. The research perspective mainly
                    focuses on the relationship between the basic connotation of songs and climate change.
                    Songs are presented by singers and their emotional expression, timbre control and action performance
                    in singing will reflect the basic requirements of the content of lyrics. In some songs describing
                    climate change, the singer needs to adjust the timbre, volume and singing method according to the lyrics
                    under the change of season, temperature, environment and other factors, so as to meet the emotional
                    performance needs of the song. Especially in the traditional multi paragraph folk songs based on season
                    or month, the tune is the same, but the content of the lyrics is gradually changing. If the singer sings
                    multiple lyrics in a completely consistent way, it will make the song seem boring and monotonous. Therefore,
                    the singing and artistic expression of singers are very important in the expression of
                    the artistic connotation of songs.</h6>

                    Yakın bir tarihte erişimin olanaksız hale gelmesi olasıdır. Kemençe imalatında kullanılan ahşapların da
