                    <h6>In this panel/round table, three scholars will give a speech within 60 minutes. The research perspective mainly
                    focuses on the relationship between the basic connotation of songs and climate change.
                    Songs are presented by singers and their emotional expression, timbre control and action performance
                    in singing will reflect the basic requirements of the content of lyrics. In some songs describing
                    climate change, the singer needs to adjust the timbre, volume and singing method according to the lyrics
                    under the change of season, temperature, environment and other factors, so as to meet the emotional
                    performance needs of the song. Especially in the traditional multi paragraph folk songs based on season
                    or month, the tune is the same, but the content of the lyrics is gradually changing. If the singer sings
                    multiple lyrics in a completely consistent way, it will make the song seem boring and monotonous. Therefore,
                    the singing and artistic expression of singers are very important in the expression of
                    the artistic connotation of songs.</h6>

                    <h6>As the whole of the 12th Hisarli Ahmet Symposium – “Music and Climate” points out, music is closely linked to
                    climatic manifestations. This is evidenced by numerous works composed in different epochs of Western music,
                    as well as more recent ones, especially those designed for certain locations – site-specific pieces – which,
                    in this case, play the role of co-authors, as their sounds are added to those of the composition.
                    There is also research into soundscape, inaugurated by Murray Schafer in the 1960s and worked out
                    today by many musicians and music lovers. In the relationship between music and education,
                    the awareness of the role of music and a of healthy and balanced environment for human life are sought.
                    In the world today, extreme situations are caused by climate instability, such as global warming, intense droughts,
                    earthquakes, excessive noise in the environment and other phenomena that endanger life on the planet. It is time for
                    fields of knowledge to come together in the search for technical, economic, artistic, ecological, political and human
                    solutions. In this context, the role of music will be shown in the awareness of perception, sensations and feelings,
                    such as in the refinement of listening and of expressive capacity. In this sense, it will be demonstrated that its role
                    is broader than serving as entertainment and pleasure. The roundtable "Environmental Activism and Music: can art point
                    to global solutions?" meets these issues, disseminating ideas and bringing proposals for musical realization in
                    the fields of performance, composition, creative practices and music education. Under the coordination of Marisa
                    Trench de Oliveira Fonterrada (IA/Unesp – Brazil), the panel will put together the Franco-Argentine composer and
                    researcher Andrea Cohen and the Brazilian composer Thiago Cury, who will certainly have a lot to say in this regard.</h6>

                    <h6>To preserve the ideal acoustic properties of musical instruments and to determine national/international
                    standards specific to the musical instrument, experimental and computational models of them need to be constructed.
                    The biggest challenge encountered in modeling is the epistemic uncertainties which arise in the design and manufacturing
                    processes of musical instruments. The most important source of uncertainty is the stochastic nature of the wooden
                    materials used in instrument making.Due to climate change, there are difficulties in accessing the reeds used in Ney making.
                    It is likely that access will become impossible in the near future. It is considered that there may be differences
                    in the natural properties of the wood used in the production of kemenche due to climate change.In our panel,
                    it is planned to discuss possible solutions and current approaches for the aforementioned problems.</h6>

                    belirlenebilmesi için deneysel ve sayısal modellerinin oluşturulmasına ihtiyaç vardır. Modellemede karşılaşılan
                    en büyük zorluk ise çalgıların tasarım ve imalat süreçlerindeki epistemik belirsizliklerdir.
                    Belirsizliğin en önemli kaynağı ise çalgı yapımında kullanılan ahşap malzemelerin stokastik doğasıdır.
                    İklim değişikliği nedeniyle Ney yapımında kullanılan kamışlara erişimde zorluklar yaşanmaktadır.
                    Yakın bir tarihte erişimin olanaksız hale gelmesi olasıdır. Kemençe imalatında kullanılan ahşapların da
                    iklim değişikliği nedeniyle doğal özelliklerinde farklılıklar oluşabileceği değerlendirilmektedir.
                    Panelimizde, anılan problemler için olası çözümler ve güncel yaklaşımların tartışılması planlanmaktadır.</h6>
